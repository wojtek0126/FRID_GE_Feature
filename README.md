Challenge to make creative shop feature in React
I had an idea how to make nice online shop feature. 
So I am about to create it.
I will make single view with item container in main container.
Data will be from local json
I will use create-react-app and local json for data
theme-ui for styles

I have shop template ready, need to fill the rest of base layout elements like with login button and fill views with buttons etc. When ready keep copy in template repo as base concept for shop apps. Next thing allign buttons and the rest. And test first item layout. Then model the layout of all with flex. Adjust template afterwards to make it fast and easy to reuse.
