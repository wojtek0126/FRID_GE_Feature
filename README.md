I am making online shop app.
It will create a template for future projects.

Data will be in local json first.
I will use create-react-app and local json server for data
theme-ui for styles
recoil.js will keep items after fetching

I have shop template ready, need to fill the rest of base layout elements like with login button and fill views with buttons etc. When ready keep copy in template repo as base concept for shop apps. Next thing allign buttons and the rest. And test first item layout. Then model the layout of all with flex. Adjust template afterwards to make it fast and easy to reuse.
